                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>4 large skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon chopped garlic</li>
                        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

                <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
                        <li>Rinse chicken breasts, pat dry with paper towels, and pierce several times with a fork. Place chicken breasts into a large resealable plastic bag and pour in olive oil. Seal and shake bag to coat chicken with olive oil; add rosemary, thyme, oregano, garlic, salt, and black pepper to the bag, seal, and shake again to coat chicken with herbs.</li>
                        <li>Grill chicken breasts on the preheated grill until the juices run clear and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C, about 10 minutes per side.</li>
